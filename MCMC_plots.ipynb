regulating the circulation whenever i find myself growing grim about the mouth whenever it is a damp driqqly november in my soul whenever i find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses and bringing up the rear of every funeral i meet and especially whenever my hypos get such an upper hand of me that it rezuires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street and methodically knocking people s hats off then i account it high time to get to sea as soon as i can this is my substitute for pistol and ball with a philosophical flourish cato throws himself upon his sword i zuietly take to the ship there is nothing surprising in this if they but knew it almost all men in their degree some time or other cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me there now is your insular city of the manhattoes belted round by wharves as indian isles by coral reefs commerce surrounds it with her surf right and left the streets take you waterward its extreme downtown is the battery where that noble mole is washed by waves and cooled by breeqes which a few hours previous were out of sight of land look at the crowds of water gaqers there circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon go from corlears hook to coenties slip and from thence by whitehall northward what do you see posted like silent sentinels all around the town stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries some leaning against the spiles some seated upon the pier heads some looking over the bulwarks of ships from china some high aloft in the rigging as if striving to get a still better seaward peep but these are all landsmen of week days pent up in lath and plaster tied to counters nailed to benches clinched to desks how then is this are the green fields gone what do they here but look here come more crowds pacing straight for the water and seemingly bound for a dive strange nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice no they must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in and there they stand miles of them leagues inlanders all they come from lanes and alleys streets and avenues north east south and west yet here they all unite tell me does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither once more say you are in the country in some high land of lakes take almost any path you please and ten to one it carries you down in a dale and leaves you there by a pool in the stream there is magic in it let the most absent minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries stand that man on his legs set his feet a going and he will infallibly lead you to water if water there be in all that region should you ever be athirst in the great american desert try this experiment if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor yes as every one knows meditation and water are wedded for ever but here is an artist he desires to paint you the dreamiest shadiest zuietest most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the saco what is the chief element he employs there stand his trees each with a hollow trunk as if a hermit and a crucifix were within and here sleeps his meadow and there sleep his cattle and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke deep into distant woodlands winds a maqy way reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill side blue but though the picture lies thus tranced and though this pine tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd s head yet all were vain unless the shepherd s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him go visit the prairies in june when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee deep among tiger lilies what is the one charm wanting water there is not a drop of water there were niagara but a cataract of sand would you travel your thousand miles to see it why did the poor poet of tennessee upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver deliberate whether to buy him a coat which he sadly needed or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him at some time or other craqy to go to sea why upon your first voyage as a passenger did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land why did the old persians hold the sea holy why did the greeks give it a separate deity and own brother of jove surely all this is not without meaning and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus who because he could not grasp the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain plunged into it and was drowned but that same image we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans it is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life and this is the key to it all now when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i begin to grow haqy', 'chaptel roomings carr me ishmaer some yeals ago nevel mind how rong plecisery having rittre ol no money in my pulse and nothing palticural to intelest me on shole

they bossiply can without falling in and there they stand miles of them leagues inlanders all they come from lanes and alleys streets and avenues north east south and west yet here they all unite tell me does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the combasses of all those shibs attract them thither once more say you are in the country in some high land of lakes take almost any bath you blease and ten to one it carries you down in a dale and leaves you there py a bool in the stream there is magic in it let the most apsent minded of men pe blunged in his deebest reveries stand that man on his legs set his feet a going and he will infalliply lead you to water if water there pe in all that region should you ever pe athirst in the great american desert try this exberiment if your caravan habben to pe subblied with a metabhysical brofessor yes as every one knows meditation and water are wedded for ever put here is an artist he desires to baint you the dreamiest shadiest zuietest most enchanting pit of romantic landscabe in all the valley of the saco what is the chief element he embloys there stand his trees each with a hollow trunk as if a hermit and a crucifix were within and here sleebs his meadow and there sleeb his cattle and ub from yonder cottage goes a sleeby smoke deeb into distant woodlands winds a maqy way reaching to overlabbing sburs of mountains pathed in their hill side plue put though the bicture lies thus tranced and though this bine tree shakes down its sighs like leaves ubon this shebherd s head yet all were vain unless the shebherd s eye were fixed ubon the magic stream pefore him go visit the brairies in june when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee deeb among tiger lilies what is the one charm wanting water there is not a drob of water there were niagara put a cataract of sand would you travel your thousand miles to see it why did the boor boet of tennessee ubon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver deliperate whether to puy him a coat which he sadly needed or invest his money in a bedestrian trib to rockaway peach why is almost every ropust healthy poy with a ropust healthy soul in him at some time or other craqy to go to sea why ubon your first voyage as a bassenger did you yourself feel such a mystical vipration when first told that you and your shib were now out of sight of land why did the old bersians hold the sea holy why did the greeks give it a sebarate deity and own prother of jove surely all this is not without meaning and still deeber the meaning of that story of narcissus who pecause he could not grasb the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain blunged into it and was drowned put that same image we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans it is the image of the ungrasbaple bhantom of life and this is the key to it all now when i say that i am in the hapit of going to sea whenever i pegin to grow haqy']\n",

      "['in germany it seems to be pretty much automatic pretty much all the time in france and spain it all depends presumably on social subtleties that you have to be french or spanish to understand

country it seems even europeans don t know the answer according to new polling by yougov in six eu countries britain and the us where as most visitors know but may be reluctant to acknowledge gratuities may make up more than half your waitperson s income europeans are deeply divided on tipping in restaurants for example of respondents in germany told the pollster they typically tipped almost the same as the us in the uk where an optional service charge of about is usually included said they left a gratuity the figure in spain where service is often included in restaurant bills but diners can leave optional tips was while in france where every price on a restaurant menu already includes for service of people said they generally tipped on top even in sweden where tips are generally not expected the figure was but only of italians said they would typically leave a gratuity after a meal out with a rather greater proportion admitting they never left a cent a startling of respondents in the us however and of germans by far the most in europe confessed they would tip sometimes or often even if the service was terrible indicating that for some tipping is not about quality of service at all the findings of the survey will come as a surprise in germany a country that does not generally think of itself as a nation of happy distributors of trinkgeld the word in a similar vein to pourboire in french means drinking money nor is germany a country whose service staff are particularly customer friendly in berlin a glass of beer or a plate of food is often served in a huff rather than with a smile not for nothing is servicew ste deutschland germany is a service desert a thing yet the data reflects a clear trend germans tend to hand over a few extra coins irrespective of how they have been treated they are the nation in europe least likely to not tip even for poor service and the most willing to pay extra for average service a continuing fondness for cash may be a factor with many taxi drivers and bars still refusing payment by card a growing awareness of labour shortages in the catering sector could also explain a change in attitude with many bars and cafes even in big cities reducing their opening hours due to a post pandemic lack of staff some barkeepers say their customers have recently become more generous tippers but if german tipping habits seem ingrained they are not always observed adding is a generally accepted rule but not always followed most customers pay me extra said mehmet dogan a berlin taxi driver but the rule doesn t apply to longer journeys i don t think i have been given a tip in years of doing my job if someone slipped me a fiver i d assume they made a mistake matthew smith yougov s head of data journalism said some may be surprised by the revelation that germans are just as likely as americans to tip service workers not least because service attitudes in germany have previously been so bad that the government felt the need to address it before the country hosted the world cup in italy tiziana nicolosi who manages quirino a bar and restaurant in central rome said the country simply doesn t have a culture for tipping we re not like americans or the british we might do it occasionally but it s not something that is expected it is rare to see a tip box by the till in a bar or restaurant in italy with some owners deeming such a display unbecoming instead they appreciate the loyalty of regular clientele who may occasionally leave a little extra after their drink or meal in recognition of quality and service rather than out of obligation many italians however leave the change after paying a bill if a coffee costs cents then a customer will usually give and let us keep the change said riccardo conti a waiter in rome for some customers leaving the small change is simply a matter of not wanting to hang around he added personally conti said he bucks the trend of non tipping italians i always leave a tip mainly in bars and restaurants he said adding it was very subjective it all depends on the individual it s a gesture you might see more from people in the south who are generally

generally not expected the figure was but only of italians said they would typically leave a gratuity after a meal out with a rather greater proportion admitting they never left a cent a startling of respondents in the us however and of germans by far the most in europe confessed they would tip sometimes or often even if the service was terrible indicating that for some tipping is not about quality of service at all the findings of the survey will come as a surprise in germany a country that does not generally think of itself as a nation of happy distributors of trinkgeld the word in a

irrespective of how they have been treated they are the nation in europe least likely to not tip even for poor service and the most willing to pay extra for average service a continuing fondness for cash may be a factor with many taxi drivers and bars still refusing payment by card a growing awareness of labour shortages in the catering sector could also explain a change in attitude with many

with some owners deeming such a display unbecoming instead they appreciate the loyalty of regular clientele who may occasionally leave a little extra after their drink or meal in recognition of

gratuities may make up more than half your waitperson s income europeans are deeply divided on tipping in restaurants for example of respondents in germany told the pollster they typically tipped almost the same as the us in the uk where an optional service charge of about is usually included said they left a gratuity the figure in spain where service is often included in restaurant bills but diners can leave optional tips was while in france where every price on a restaurant menu already includes for service of people said they generally tipped on top even in sweden where tips are generally not expected the figure was but only of italians said they would typically leave a gratuity after a meal out with a rather greater proportion admitting they never left a cent a startling of respondents in the us however and of germans by far the most in europe confessed they would tip sometimes or often even if the service was terrible indicating that for some tipping is not about quality of service at all the findings of the survey will come as a surprise in germany a country that does not generally think of itself as a nation of happy distributors of trinkgeld the word in a

irrespective of how they have been treated they are the nation in europe least likely to not tip even for poor service and the most willing to pay extra for average service a continuing fondness for cash may be a factor with many taxi drivers and bars still refusing payment by card a growing awareness of labour shortages in the catering sector could also explain a change in attitude with many
