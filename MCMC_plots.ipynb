but knew it almost all men in their degree some time or other cherish very nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me there now is your insular city of the manhattoes belted round by wharves as indian isles by coral reefs commerce surrounds it with her surf right and left the streets take you waterward its extreme downtown is the battery where that noble mole is washed by waves and cooled by breezes which a few hours previous were out of sight of land look at the crowds of water gazers there circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon go from corlears hook to coenties slip and from thence by whitehall northward what do you see posted like silent sentinels all around the town stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries some leaning against the spiles some seated upon the pier heads some looking over the bulwarks of ships from china some high aloft in the rigging as if striving to get a still better seaward peep but these are all landsmen of week days pent up in lath and plaster tied to counters nailed to benches clinched to desks how then is this are the green fields gone what do they here but look here come more crowds pacing straight for the water and seemingly bound for a dive strange nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice no they must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in and there they stand miles of them leagues inlanders all they come from lanes and alleys streets and avenues north east south and west yet here they all unite tell me does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither once more say you are in the country in some high land of lakes take almost any path you please and ten to one it carries you down in a dale and leaves you there by a pool in the stream there is magic in it let the most absent minded of men be plunged in his deepest reveries stand that man on his legs set his feet a going and he will infallibly lead you to water if water there be in all that region should you ever be athirst in the great american desert try this experiment if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor yes as every one knows meditation and water are wedded for ever but here is an artist he desires to paint you the dreamiest shadiest quietest most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the saco what is the chief element he employs there stand his trees each with a hollow trunk as if a hermit and a crucifix were within and here sleeps his meadow and there sleep his cattle and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hill side blue but though the picture lies thus tranced and though this pine tree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherd s head yet all were vain unless the shepherd s eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him go visit the prairies in june when for scores on scores of miles you wade knee deep among tiger lilies what is the one charm wanting water there is not a drop of water there were niagara but a cataract of sand would you travel your thousand miles to see it why did the poor poet of tennessee upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver deliberate whether to buy him a coat which he sadly needed or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him at some time or other crazy to go to sea why upon your first voyage as a passenger did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land why did the old persians hold the sea holy why did the greeks give it a separate deity and own brother of jove surely all this is not without meaning and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus who because he could not grasp the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain plunged into it and was drowned but that same image we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans it is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life and this is the key to it all now when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i begin to grow hazy about the eyes and begin to be over conscious of my lungs i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go']"
